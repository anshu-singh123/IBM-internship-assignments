      <h1>Drums</h1>
        <p align="justify">
          The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments.
          In the Hornbostel–Sachs classification system, it is a
          membranophone.[1] Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a
          drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck,
          either directly with the player's hands, or with a percussion mallet,
          to produce sound. There is usually a resonant head on the underside of
          the drum. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make
          sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most
          ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained
          virtually unchanged for thousands of years.[1] Drum of Company B, 40th

          single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always
          played in this way. Others are normally played in a set of two or
          more, all played by one player, such as bongo drums and timpani. A
          number of different drums together with cymbals form the basic modern
          drum kit. Many drums are played together with other instruments.

          Drums are usually played as rhythm instruments, keeping a steady beat
          or tempo for other musicians to follow. Drums are often used to
          provide the rhythmic foundation in many types of music, and in
          popular music styles such as rock and pop music, the drum part is
          often referred to as the drum groove. In many traditional cultures,
          drums have a symbolic function and are used in religious ceremonies.
          Drums are often used in music therapy, especially hand drums, because
          of their tactile nature and easy use by a wide variety of people.
